# FediFollow-Chrome
A Chrome extension that simplifies following Fediverse users on other instances than your own by automatically redirecting you to your instance when pressing a follow button. Should work for other Chromium browsers too, as well as Kiwi browser on Android. It was tested with about 20 instances and supports different instance layouts/designs.

I made this since I could only find a working extension for Firefox, that does the same (Simplified Federation).

## Installation
Right now, you need to install it using developer mode. I plan to put this in the Chrome Webstore soon, though.
1. Download this repository or the current release zip and extract it somewhere.
2. Go to your Chrome extension page and enable developer mode.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and then select the folder of the unpacked extension (should be "FediFollow-Chrome-main").

## Setup
- Click the extension icon to set your Mastadon instance (like "infosec.exchange").



## Todos
- Update to manifest v3
- Review if permissions in current manifest are actually needed like that
- If I find myself to be bored, probably more
